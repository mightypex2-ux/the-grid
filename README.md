## Overview

The GRID is a general-purpose distributed computing environment secured by zero-knowledge proofs and post-quantum cryptography.

It allows anyone to contribute unused compute capacity to a verifiable, decentralized execution layer for internet services. The network supports encrypted storage, decentralized identity, and AI workloads (including inference, agent sandboxing, and training), without requiring trust in operators.

The objective is to build a global, decentralized alternative to traditional hyperscaler cloud infrastructure that is faster, lower cost, cryptographically verifiable, and aligned with sovereignty, privacy, and long-term security.

What are the core concepts behind THE GRID?

1. **Sectors:** The fundamental unit of data on the network. Each Sector is encrypted client-side (Poseidon sponge + hybrid ChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope), propagated via GossipSub, and persisted locally in RocksDB. Plaintext never touches the wire.

2. **Programs:** Application-level namespaces that organize Sectors by purpose. Built-in programs include ZID (decentralized identity) and Interlink (encrypted messaging). Nodes subscribe to the programs they care about and data is propagated automatically.

3. **Proofs:** Zero-knowledge proofs that let nodes verify a Sector is correctly shaped and encrypted without ever seeing its contents. The first supported proof system is Groth16 over BN254, with the architecture designed to support additional proof systems as they mature.

ZODE is the first native reference implementation of THE GRID.

You can read the first official protocol spec here: https://github.com/cypher-asi/the-grid/blob/master/docs/grid-protocol.md

Two ZODE applications ship in this workspace:

- **zode-app** — a standalone desktop GUI built with eframe / egui.
- **zode-cli** — a console TUI built with ratatui / crossterm.
- **grid-relayd** — a standalone public relay service for relay-first NAT connectivity.

See [Run a ZODE](docs/run-a-zode.md) for prerequisites, build instructions, and configuration.

## Principles

1. **Agency:** Your key material is your account. Identity keys are generated on-device via Shamir secret sharing; shares never leave your machines. No server, no custodian.
2. **Privacy:** Data is encrypted client-side (Poseidon sponge + hybrid ChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope) before it touches the network. Zero-knowledge proofs let nodes verify sector validity without seeing plaintext.
3. **Decentralization:** Fully peer-to-peer over libp2p/QUIC. GossipSub propagation, request-response exchange, optional Kademlia DHT. No central server; any node can join or leave freely.
4. **Post-Quantum:** PQ-hybrid cryptography: Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 signing, X25519 + ML-KEM-768 key agreement. Sector encryption uses ZK-friendly Poseidon over BN254.
5. **Open Source:** MIT-licensed Rust workspace. Every layer is auditable and reusable.
